Great! Let's take it to the next level with a more advanced project that will force you to use everything youâ€™ve learned â€” plus some new concepts like form validation, grouping inputs, and styling!

ðŸš€ Advanced Project: User Registration Form with Custom Styling
âœ… Task:
Create a User Registration Form that collects the following information:

Full Name â†’ text input

Username â†’ text input

Email â†’ email input

Password â†’ password input

Confirm Password â†’ password input

Age â†’ number input (must be at least 18)

Gender â†’ radio buttons (Male, Female, Other)

Interests â†’ multiple checkboxes (e.g., Music, Sports, Coding, etc.)

Country â†’ select dropdown (at least 5 countries)

Bio â†’ textarea for personal description

Finally:

âœ… Add two buttons:

One to submit the form.

One to reset all fields.

âœ… Advanced Requirements:
All fields must have required attributes where appropriate.

Use placeholder text for inputs like name, username, email, etc.

Use label tags correctly connected with for and id.

Style the form beautifully with CSS:

Center the form on the page.

Add padding, margin, and box shadows.

Style buttons with hover effects.

Style inputs with rounded corners.

Use fieldset and legend to group related inputs:

One for personal info.

One for account info.

One for preferences.

âœ… Optional for Extra Challenge:
Use CSS :focus and :hover pseudo-classes for interactivity.

Use HTML attributes like pattern or minlength for basic validation.

Use disabled attribute for one option in the select (e.g., "Select your country").

âœ… Deliverable:
An HTML file with the complete form, fully styled with internal or external CSS.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Learning Objectives:
Correct use of form attributes (name, id, required, etc.).

Organizing complex forms using fieldset and legend.

Using different input types.

Adding accessible labels.

Styling forms and buttons with CSS.

âœ… Example visual layout:
